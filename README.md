# Welcome to The Resent Launcher!
Here we (and by we I mean me and Nitwit) have 2 options and 2 options only.

## Legacy Build 
The legacy build is the version of Resent Client that were before the website got taken down, it contains lots of features and loads a bit quicker but lacks some of the newer ones (1.7 animations and cosmetics)

## 3.5 Build
This used to be the "development" build, but the bugs have been fixed soooooo ywah.

## 1.5 build?
im not doing it.
you: "oh but why?"
Me: Im lazy, and its pretty much uuuhhhhhhh... OBSOLETE at this point.

## Credits
