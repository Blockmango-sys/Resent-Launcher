Ok this is my first time writing a readme.md file
i can do this...

# Welcome to The resent Launcher!
Here we (and by we I mean me and Nitwit) have 2 options and 2 options only.

## Stable Build 
The stable build has Plenty of features (I didn't count but lets say about 20+), but lacks newer features

## Development Build
The development build has newer features but has some bugs (they will get fixed, development is not up to me, I only made the launcher)

## Credits
### 90% of the Work
Nitwit (hooman#1196) He coded everything from the client.

### The launcher
Technix_ (im probably on eagler)
